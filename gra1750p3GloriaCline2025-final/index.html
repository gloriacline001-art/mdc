        <li>6 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 can (14 oz) sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>1 can whole milk (use the condensed milk can to measure)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>

		<ol>
			
      <li>Caramelize the sugar.
        Add the sugar directly into the mold and place it over medium heat on the stove. Allow it to melt slowly, swirling the mold carefully so the sugar melts evenly. Once golden, remove from the heat and spread the caramel around the bottom and sides of the mold. Let it cool.</li>
      <li> Prepare the double boiler
        In a large pot (big enough to fit the mold), add a little water and bring it to a gentle simmer. This will serve as the base for the bain-marie (double boiler). Make sure the pot has a lid.</li>
      <li>In a blender combine: eggs, condense mil, regular milk, vanilla  blend until is well blended.</li>
      <li>Blend the mixture
        In a blender, combine the eggs, condensed milk, regular milk (measured with the condensed milk can), and vanilla. Blend until smooth and well mixed.</li>
      <li>Fill the mold
        Pour the blended mixture into the caramelized mold once the caramel has cooled to room temperature.</li>
      <li>Cook the quesillo
        Place the mold into the pot with simmering water. The water should reach about halfway up the sides of the mold. Cover both the mold and the pot with their lids. Cook over medium-high heat for about 1 hour, checking occasionally to ensure there is enough water (add more hot water if necessary). Make sure the mold does not float.</li>
      <li>Check doneness
        After 1 hour, insert a toothpick or thin knife into the center. If it comes out clean, the quesillo is ready.</li>
      <li>After one hour the quesillo shall be ready.</li>
      <li>Cool and serve
        Remove the mold carefully from the pot and allow it to cool completely. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours before unmolding and serving.</li>
    </ol>

      <h4>Tips and Notes</h4>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li> Caramel care: Watch the sugar closely—it can burn fast. Swirl instead of stirring for even melting.</li>
      <li>Water level: Keep water halfway up the mold’s sides. Add more hot water if needed, but don’t let the mold float.</li>
      <li>Texture control: For a firmer quesillo, cook an extra 10 minutes; for a softer one, reduce the time slightly.</li>
      <li>Flavor variations: Try adding a splash of rum, coconut milk, or citrus zest for a delicious twist.</li>
      <li>Unmolding tip: Run a thin knife around the edges before flipping to release smoothly.</li>
    </ul>
